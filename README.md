# English Introduction

This is fork from http://github.com/wendal/gor.git

## gor -- A static websites and blog generator engine written in Go
===

Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.
`gor` is a [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/) like websites and blog generator engine written in [Go](http://golang.org/). It's almost compatible to ruhoh 1.x specification. You can treat gor as a replacement of the official implementation what is written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

Why reinvent a wheel? gor has following awesome benefits:

1. Speed -- Less than 1 second when compiling all my near 200 blogs on wendal.net
2. Simple -- Only one single executable file generated after compiling, no other dependence

## Installation
====================
To install:

Compile to generate static web page

Local preview
-------
gor also comes with a built-in development server that will allow you to preview what the generated site will look like in your browser locally.
